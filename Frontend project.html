                                      This virus was first defected in Wuhan City, Hubei Provincem China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person.
                                      It's important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measels), while other viruses are less so.

                                    that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

                                    How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts,
                                    and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.

                                    The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
                                    The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.
                                    Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.

                                  It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months
                                  but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when
                                  weather becomes warmer. There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

                                Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating 
                                food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
                              </p>   
                              <p>
                                It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                              </p>   
                              <p>
                                In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                        <strong>Why? </strong>Washing your hands with soap and water on using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands

                                      Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing
                                      <p><strong>Why? </strong>When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>
                                    </li>

                                      Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                                      <p><strong>Why? </strong>Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyws, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</p>

                                      Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth
                                      and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                                      <p><strong>Why? </strong>Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>

                                      Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advice. Foloow the directions of your local health authority.

                                  If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, 
                                  keep away from  others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay 
                                  home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor. More information on how to prepare, what to do if you get sick, and how

                                Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be 
                                used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                                WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks (<span class="text-primary">see Advice on the use of masks</span>).

                                The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of 
                                at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information.

                                      The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, 
                                      sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel 
                                      unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously 
                                      ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more 
                                      likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                      The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach 
                                      out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by 
                                      commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

                                      <li><strong>Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation.</strong> Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your household’s daily routine.</li>
                                      <li><strong>Continue practicing everyday preventive actions.</strong>
                                        Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. 
                                        Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.

                                      <li><strong>Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.</strong>
                                        Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
                                      </li>
                                      <li><strong>Stay in touch with others by phone or email.</strong>
                                        If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe 
                                        illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.

                                        This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19

                                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to 
                                    always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                                  </p>   
                                  <p>
                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                  Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can.

                                  Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.

                                  Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
                                </p>     
                                <p>
                                  However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.
                                </p>

                                No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection against the new coronavirus.
                              </p>     
                              <p>
                                The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their efforts.
                              </p>    
                              <p>
                                Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
